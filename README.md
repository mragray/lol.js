# lol.js makes it easy to provide inline form validation and save progress in local storage incase of interruption.

## This is a work in progress and is not ready for use.

### Todo (in no order):
- Include settings parrams
- Make lol global
- use event delegation for form target
- write docs

### Todo later:
- use module exports for node / browserify modules
